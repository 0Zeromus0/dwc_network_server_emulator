nintendo_dwc_emulator
=====================

A Nintendo DS (and possibly Wii) server emulator.


Open source projects referenced during the creation of this project:
OpenSpy Core - https://github.com/sfcspanky/Openspy-Core/
Luigi Auriemma's Gslist and enctypex_decoder - http://aluigi.altervista.org/papers.htm


Compatibility:
The following games have been tested with varying results.

Tetris DS (U) - Friends only games are playable. Worldwide matchmaking does not work.
Jump Ultimate Stars (J) - Friends only games are playable. Worldwide matchmaking does not work. Voice untested.
Phantasy Star Zero (U) - "Play Alone" and playing with friends works. Matchmaking does not work.

Matchmaking as a whole right now has not been implemented so it will most likely not work in any game yet.
